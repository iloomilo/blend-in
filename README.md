# 🕵️ BlendIn – The Secret Word Game for Discord

**BlendIn** is a fun and social word game designed to be played with friends over **Discord**. It's all about bluffing, guessing, and blending in. One player is the **Impostor**, and everyone else is trying to figure out who it is — without giving away the secret word.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open the [BlendIn](https://blendin.deno.dev/) in your browser.
2. Start a game and share the game code or link with your friends on Discord.
3. Everyone joins using their browser (no login required).
4. The game assigns a **secret word** to all players — except one: the **Impostor**.
5. Each player must say a **related word** (out loud on Discord!) that hints at the secret word — without giving it away.
6. The Impostor must make something up and try to **blend in**.
7. After one round, everyone votes for who they think the Impostor is.
8. If the group guesses correctly, they win. If not, the Impostor wins!
